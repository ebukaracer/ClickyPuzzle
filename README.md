# ClickyPuzzle
*<b>Clicky Puzzle</b> is a 2D mobile hyper-casual game I developed from scratch using unity. After having a nostalgic experience about the physical sliding-puzzle games I used to play back then, I got inspired and decided to recreate it this time in a non-physical manner.*

## Game Logic:
The main idea behind this project is simply what you would expect in a casual sliding puzzle mechanics where youâ€™re presented with bunch of scattered images(grid-like) to arrange.Â  Playerâ€™s goal is to organize the scattered squares or Images by matching them to their initial positions in other to achieve their initial organized structure.

## Mechanic:
The game is built while having just one dimension in mind. Currently the game is built separately for dimensions *3X3* and *4X4*(`download links below`). The fixed dimensions can also be expanded in the unity editor to fit-in *5X5*, *6X6*, etc. Larger dimensions will tend to up the game's difficulty. These dimensions are just grids in rows and columns. Hence *3X3* is simply 3 rows/columns forming a total of 9 grids. The same applies for other dimensions. 

## Tools Used:
* Unity 2020.3.10f1 
* Visual Studio (IDE)
* C# (Language)
